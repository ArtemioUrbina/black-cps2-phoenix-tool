# black-cps2-phoenix-tool

Can use a CPS3 board to revive black CPS2 all in one PCBs. This method is obsolete, please check the arduino nano or arduino methods
https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/No-Battery-CPS2

The method uses a CD-ROM image from a CPS3 game, by using thsi executable to inject the phoenied roms fro the Razoola or Avalaunch sets via the SIMM installer form the CPS3 game.

A few bytes will be corrupted due to the checksums needed by CPS3 hardware.
